Letâ€™s install the library

```bash
git clone https://github.com/taindp98/Loggify-LLM.git
cd Loggify-LLM
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Prerequisite**: Setting Up MongoDB Atlas

Before proceeding with this repository, please ensure you have set up your own `MongoDB Atlas` cluster. This project requires access to a MongoDB database for data storage and retrieval. Follow these steps to create your MongoDB Atlas cluster:

1. **Sign Up/Log In to MongoDB Atlas:**
   - Go to the [MongoDB Atlas website](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
   - Sign up for a new account or log in to your existing account.

2. **Create a New Cluster:**
   - Click on "Build a Cluster" and select the free tier or any plan that suits your needs.
   - Choose your preferred cloud provider and region.

3. **Configure Your Cluster:**
   - Follow the prompts to configure your cluster settings.
   - Once configured, click "Create Cluster."

4. **Add Your IP Address:**
   - In the Security section, click on "Network Access" and add your IP address to the whitelist.

5. **Create a Database User:**
   - In the Security section, click on "Database Access" and create a new database user with appropriate permissions.

6. **Connect to Your Cluster:**
   - Once your cluster is ready, click on "Connect" and choose a connection method.
   - Copy the connection string provided and replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<your-cluster-url>` with your database user credentials and cluster URL.

7. **Update Configuration in This Repository:**
   - Replace the placeholder connection string in the project's configuration file with your MongoDB Atlas connection string.

By completing these steps, you'll ensure that your MongoDB Atlas cluster is ready for use with this project. If you need further assistance, please refer to the [MongoDB Atlas documentation](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/).

Create the `.env` file containing `OPENAI_API_KEY` the connection to the `MongoDB Atlas`

```
## OPENAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***

## MONGODB
COLLECTION_NAME=<your-collection-name>
DB_NAME=<your-database-name>
CLUSTER_ADDRESS=<your-cluster-ip-address>
USRNAME=<provided-user-name>
PASSWD=<provided-password>
```

An example for logging a certain LLM request:

```python
from loggify_llm.chat.chat_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI()

system_prompt = """
    You possess in-depth knowledge of natural images and can describe them with ease. \
    From the given input text indicating the category name of a certain object, your task involves the following steps:
    1-Imagine a scene containing the input object.
    2-Generate 4 descriptions about different key appearance features of the input object from the imagined scene, with each description having a maximum of 16 words.
    3-Output a JSON object containing the following key:
        "description": <list of 4 descriptions>

    Use the following examples:
        Input text: "sea lion"
        Answer: "description": ["A round-bellied seal sits on a rock, looking intently at something off-camera.", "The seal lies with flippers tucked, sleek body well-maintained.", "The seal's thick, smooth fur and large dark eyes show alertness and curiosity.", "Turquoise water contrasts with the seal's brown fur and grey rock, highlighting its natural environment."]
"""
response = llm.request(system_prompt=system_prompt, user_prompt="British shorthair")
print(response)
```

the output follows:

```bash
